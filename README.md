Robot Gladiators is a browser game written entirely in Javascript.  It's very basic, but allowed me to practice writing functions, defining variables, and getting the hang of for loops and while statements in Javascript. 

## description

Through a series of prompts and confirms, the user can choose their Robot's name, and then battle other robots.  The enemy robots names are chosen randomly from their array.  The user can choose to battle, or skip a battle.  In between fighting enemy robots, the user can choose to visit the store to re-up on health or upgrade their attack value. This costs money.  

As long as the user's robot still has health (AKA, is still alive), they can continue battling enemy robots.  If they make it to the end of the round, their score is recorded, and compared to the high score to see if they have beat it. 

Now, I am aware that this may be the lamest game ever created.  Personally, I prefer Tetris. But it was a good chance to practice Javascript, storing information, creating for loops, and manipulating arrays.  

Thanks for playing, and good luck!
